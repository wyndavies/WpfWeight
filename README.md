<b>WpfWeight</b>

The first project I created in WPF. It shows a conversion between Imperial and Metric and calculates BMI. Height is hard-coded at the moment.
The project uses custom button animations as I didn't like the default. The amount of code I had to create to replace the mouse-over animation was ridiculous.
